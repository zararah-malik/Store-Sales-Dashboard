## How I approached?/ Project Execution:

The project was completed in two major phases:

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: The dataset was cleaned using **Power Query** in Power BI. This involved removing nulls and duplicates, correcting date formats, standardizing categories, and ensuring accurate data types for analysis.
  
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI was used to build an interactive and insightful dashboard. Key performance indicators (KPIs), bar charts, donut charts, and line graphs were used to explore relationships between categories, time, segments, and payment modes.

## This dashboard is useful for:

- **Retail business owners and managers** who want to track sales and profitability.
- **Operations teams** analyzing shipping methods and customer segments.
- **Marketing strategists** aiming to identify top-selling products and seasonal trends.
- **Stakeholders** looking for a high-level view of performance and areas to improve.

## Key Insights:

- Office Supplies lead in both **sales (41%)** and **quantity sold (13.6K units)**.
- **Phones** are the top-performing sub-category in terms of revenue.
- **Standard Class** is the most preferred shipping method with over **$1M in sales**.
- **Cash on Delivery (COD)** generated the highest profit (46.84% share).
- **December** had the highest sales; **April** had the lowest, showing seasonal variation.

## Recommendations:

- Increase marketing and inventory focus on high-performing sub-categories like **Phones** and **Chairs**.
- Promote **Standard shipping** as it appears to be cost-effective and popular.
- Encourage customers to use **COD**, which results in higher profitability.
- Launch sales campaigns in **April** to boost revenue during low-performing months.
- Continue investing in **Office Supplies**, the most profitable category.
